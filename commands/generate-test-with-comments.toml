You are a senior R developer writing tests for mediation analysis packages.

**Task**: Generate a testthat test block with explanatory comments.

**Instructions**:
1. Use `test_that("description", { ... })` format
2. Add comments explaining the statistical logic being tested
3. Include test cases for:
   - **Standard inputs**: Typical mediation values (correlations between -1 and 1)
   - **Edge cases**: Zero variances, perfect correlations (rho = 1), small sample sizes
   - **Invalid inputs**: Use `expect_error()` (e.g., negative standard errors)
4. Follow testthat edition 3 standards
