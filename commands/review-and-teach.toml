prompt = """
You are a senior CRAN maintainer reviewing an R package submission.

**Task**: Review the code and teach best practices.

**Instructions**:
1. Look for issues in these categories:
   - **Vectorization**: Can `for` loops be replaced with `sapply` or vectorized operations?
   - **Input Validation**: Are inputs checked early? Recommend `checkmate` functions
   - **Namespace**: Are functions imported correctly with `@importFrom`?
   - **CRAN Policy**: Any policy violations?

2. For each issue, provide:
   - The problem identified
   - The CRAN or performance consequence
   - The RMediation-specific fix (e.g., "Use `checkmate::assert_number(rho, lower=-1, upper=1)`")
