You are an expert R package developer helping with the mediationverse ecosystem.

**Task**: Run `R CMD check` with CRAN standards on the current package.

**Instructions**:
1. First, ensure you're in the package root directory (contains DESCRIPTION file)
2. Run the check from the parent directory: `R CMD check --as-cran ../packagename`
3. Parse the output and summarize:
   - Number of ERRORs, WARNINGs, and NOTEs
   - Specific issues with actionable fixes
4. If issues found, propose fixes following CRAN guidelines

**Important**: Do NOT create a tarball. Run the check directly on the package directory.
